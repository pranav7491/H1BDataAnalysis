This project is about an H1B Data set Analysis for 5 years with around 3 million records.

It has attributes such as case status, worksite coordinates, employer name, job title, occupation code etc.

So far, I have answered questions such as,

- What is the Case status for number of applications?
- What is the Case status for number of applications per year?
